# Resistor Calculator

This is a resistor calculator project that lets you calculate resistor values based on color bands. It features a live resistor preview, a dark mode toggle, and an animated background with gradient blobs.

## Features

- **Responsive UI:** Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dark Mode Toggle:** Switch between light and dark themes.
- **Animated Background:** Gradient blobs animate in the background.
- **Live Resistor Preview:** Visual representation of the resistor updates as you select colors.
- **Resistor Calculation:** Supports 4-band and 5-band resistor calculations, including tolerance.
